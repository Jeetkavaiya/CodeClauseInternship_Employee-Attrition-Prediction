## Introduction

Employee attrition is a significant concern for many organizations. Predicting which employees are likely to leave the company can help in taking proactive measures to retain valuable talent. This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict employee attrition based on various features such as job satisfaction, salary, and work environment.

## Project Structure


- `data/`: Folder containing raw and processed data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model training.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Folder to save trained models.
- `reports/`: Folder for reports and visualizations.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `config.yaml`: Configuration file for project settings.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Employee-Attrition-Prediction.git
    cd Employee-Attrition-Prediction
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Preprocess the data:
    ```sh
    python scripts/data_preprocessing.py
    ```

2. Perform feature engineering:
    ```sh
    python scripts/feature_engineering.py
    ```

3. Train the model:
    ```sh
    python scripts/train_model.py
    ```

4. Evaluate the model:
    ```sh
    python scripts/evaluate_model.py
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is hypothetical and contains various features such as:
- Employee ID
- Age
- Gender
- Department
- Job Role
- Job Satisfaction
- Monthly Income
- Over Time
- Years at Company
- Attrition (Target Variable)

Ensure the dataset is placed in the `data/raw/` directory.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves transforming raw data into meaningful features that can be used for machine learning. This includes:
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Handling missing values.
- Creating new features from existing ones.

## Modeling

Different machine learning algorithms are used to build the prediction model, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
- Gradient Boosting

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using Grid Search or Random Search to optimize model performance.

## Evaluation

Model evaluation is done using various metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC AUC Score

Cross-validation is used to ensure the model's robustness.

## Results

The final model's performance is summarized, and important features contributing to employee attrition are highlighted. Visualization of results and feature importance is provided in the `reports/figures/` directory.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
